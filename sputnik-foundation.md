# Sputnik Foundation

The **Sputnik Foundation** is a DAO that will be responsible for the launch of the [Sputnik Network App-chain](sputnik-network-app-chain/)

The responsibilities of the **Sputnik Foundation** will include:

* Making decisions on the distribution of funds that remain after the initial distribution
* Delegating funds to validators that join the network after genesis
* Making decisions on unexpected issues that must be made in the shortest possible time and cannot wait for a general vote within the network

Any funds that remain with the **Sputnik Foundation** after the transition to [PostState](token-usdsignal/usdsignal-tokenomics/transition-to-poststate-blockchain-security.md) security will be burned
