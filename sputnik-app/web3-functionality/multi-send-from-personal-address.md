# Multi-Send from Personal Address

In the [**Personal Account**](../personal-account.md), the [**User**](../../glossary-of-terms-and-scheme/user.md) can send tokens or NFTs from the [**Personal Address**](../../glossary-of-terms-and-scheme/personal-address.md) by a list that consists of blockchain-addresses, usernames, or emails&#x20;

For this:&#x20;

* The [**User**](../../glossary-of-terms-and-scheme/user.md) must select "Multi-Send" in the [**Personal Account**](../personal-account.md) menu&#x20;
* Select own [**Personal Address**](../../glossary-of-terms-and-scheme/personal-address.md) as the sender&#x20;
* As recipients, specify a list of blockchain-addresses, or Telegram, Twitter, Discord usernames, or emails&#x20;
* Input the amount and type of tokens&#x20;
* Click on the "Multi-send" button&#x20;
* [**Sputnik App**](../) will access the [**Internal Record**](../web2-functionality/internal-record.md) and create a transaction where the recipients, instead of usernames and/or emails, will be the blockchain-addresses that [**Sputnik App**](../) associates with the specified usernames and/or emails&#x20;
* [**Sputnik App**](../) will contact the [**Crypto-wallet**](../../glossary-of-terms-and-scheme/crypto-wallet.md) so that the [**User**](../../glossary-of-terms-and-scheme/user.md) signs the sending transaction from the [**Personal Address**](../../glossary-of-terms-and-scheme/personal-address.md)&#x20;
* After the [**User**](../../glossary-of-terms-and-scheme/user.md) signs the transaction, tokens or NFTs will be sent from the [**Personal Address**](../../glossary-of-terms-and-scheme/personal-address.md) by a list of blockchain addresses&#x20;

For all usernames and emails for which the [**Internal Record**](../web2-functionality/internal-record.md) does not contain data on association with blockchain-addresses, the [**App Address**](../../glossary-of-terms-and-scheme/app-address.md) will be indicated as the recipient, and the “memo” field will contain a link to the [**Internal Record**](../web2-functionality/internal-record.md) in which [**Sputnik App**](../) recorded the amount, type of tokens, and recipients&#x20;

Once recipients link their username or email, [**Sputnik App**](../) will access the [**Internal Record**](../web2-functionality/internal-record.md) and give them access to the tokens or NFTs that were sent by their username or email&#x20;

If no one attaches these usernames or emails to their [**Personal Account**](../personal-account.md) within a year, [**Sputnik App**](../) will send these tokens from the [**App Address**](../../glossary-of-terms-and-scheme/app-address.md) to the [**Sputnik Network App-chain**](../../sputnik-network-app-chain/) **Community Pool**
