# Send from Personal Address

When the [**User**](../../glossary-of-terms-and-scheme/user.md) sends tokens or NFTs from the [**Personal Address**](../../glossary-of-terms-and-scheme/personal-address.md), the [**User**](../../glossary-of-terms-and-scheme/user.md) uses the [**Sputnik App**](../) as the user interface to send the transaction on the blockchain, and for this the [**User**](../../glossary-of-terms-and-scheme/user.md) needs to sign the transaction using a [**Crypto-wallet**](../../glossary-of-terms-and-scheme/crypto-wallet.md) - this is a decentralized functionality and the [**Sputnik App**](../) does not have access to the tokens located at [**Personal Address**](../../glossary-of-terms-and-scheme/personal-address.md)&#x20;

To send tokens or NFTs from a [**Personal Address**](../../glossary-of-terms-and-scheme/personal-address.md) to any other blockchain-address, either by username or email:&#x20;

* The [**User**](../../glossary-of-terms-and-scheme/user.md) must select "Send" in the [**Personal Account**](../personal-account.md) menu&#x20;
* As the recipient, input Telegram, Twitter, Discord username, or email
* Input the amount and type of tokens&#x20;
* Click on the "Send" button&#x20;
* [**Sputnik App**](../) will access the [**Internal Record**](../web2-functionality/internal-record.md) and create a transaction where the recipient is the blockchain-address associated with a username or email in the [**Internal Record**](../web2-functionality/internal-record.md)
* [**Sputnik App**](../) will contact the [**Crypto-wallet**](../../glossary-of-terms-and-scheme/crypto-wallet.md) so that the [**User**](../../glossary-of-terms-and-scheme/user.md) signs the sending transaction from the [**Personal Address**](../../glossary-of-terms-and-scheme/personal-address.md)&#x20;
* Once the [**User**](../../glossary-of-terms-and-scheme/user.md) signs the transaction, the tokens or NFTs will be sent from the [**Personal Address**](../../glossary-of-terms-and-scheme/personal-address.md)&#x20;

If the [**Internal Record**](../web2-functionality/internal-record.md) does not contain data on the association of the username or email with the blockchain-address, then the [**App Address**](../../glossary-of-terms-and-scheme/app-address.md) will be indicated as the recipient, and the Telegram, Twitter or Discord username or email will be indicated in the “memo” field&#x20;

[**Sputnik App**](../) uses the username or email address specified in the "memo" field to record information into the [**Internal Record**](../web2-functionality/internal-record.md) about which [**User**](../../glossary-of-terms-and-scheme/user.md) will need to receive tokens or NFTs when linking the username or email&#x20;

If no one links these usernames or emails in the [**Personal Account**](../personal-account.md) within a year, [**Sputnik App**](../) will send these tokens from the [**App Address**](../../glossary-of-terms-and-scheme/app-address.md) to the [**Sputnik Network App-chain**](../../sputnik-network-app-chain/) **Community Pool**
