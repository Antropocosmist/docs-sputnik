# Brief about Sputnik App

* [**Sputnik App**](../glossary-of-terms-and-scheme/sputnik-app.md) is an application that allows users to send and receive any tokens from Cosmos Ecosystem projects not only by blockchain-address, but also by Telegram, Twitter, Discord usernames and/or email&#x20;
* [**Sputnik App**](../glossary-of-terms-and-scheme/sputnik-app.md) allows users to send tokens by a list, which consists of usernames, emails and/or blockchain-addresses&#x20;
* [**Sputnik App**](../glossary-of-terms-and-scheme/sputnik-app.md) allows users to send NFTs individually or by the list, which consists of usernames, emails and/or blockchain-addresses&#x20;

[**Sputnik App**](../glossary-of-terms-and-scheme/sputnik-app.md) consists of two parts: [**Web2 (centralized)**](web2-functionality/) and [**Web3 (decentralized)**](web3-functionality/)&#x20;

* [**Web2**](web2-functionality/) and [**Web3**](web3-functionality/) parts are completely independent of each other, but if the [**User**](../glossary-of-terms-and-scheme/user.md) wishes, they can interact with each other&#x20;
* The [**Web2**](web2-functionality/) part is centralized, partially based on [**Akash**](https://akash.network/) (a decentralized server), stores private keys of the [**App Address**](../glossary-of-terms-and-scheme/app-address.md) and [**Internal Addresses**](../glossary-of-terms-and-scheme/internal-address.md) of users in encrypted form, and can sign transactions from the [**App Address**](../glossary-of-terms-and-scheme/app-address.md) and [**Internal Addresses**](../glossary-of-terms-and-scheme/internal-address.md) of users
* The [**Web3**](web3-functionality/) part is decentralized, based on the [**Sputnik Network App-chain**](../glossary-of-terms-and-scheme/sputnik-network-app-chain.md), and essentially represents a user interface for easy access to the functionality of the [**Sputnik Network App-chain**](../glossary-of-terms-and-scheme/sputnik-network-app-chain.md), as well as for the interaction of the [**Sputnik App**](./) with various blockchains, tools and dApps from the [**Cosmos Ecosystem**](../glossary-of-terms-and-scheme/cosmos-ecosystem.md)
