# Web2 functionality

**Web2 functionality** is centralized and represents transactions from an [**Internal Address**](../../glossary-of-terms-and-scheme/internal-address.md)&#x20;

In fact, **Web2 functionality** is performed by [**Sputnik App**](../) - the [**User**](../../glossary-of-terms-and-scheme/user.md) contacts [**Sputnik App**](../) so that the application signs the transaction from the user's [**Internal Address**](../../glossary-of-terms-and-scheme/internal-address.md)&#x20;

[**Sputnik App**](../) has access to all tokens that are located on the user's [**Internal Address**](../../glossary-of-terms-and-scheme/internal-address.md)&#x20;

To implement **Web2 functionality**, [**Sputnik App**](../) accesses the [**Internal Record** ](internal-record.md)

**Web2 functionality** consists of:&#x20;

* [**Linking usernames, email or Personal Addresses to user's Internal Address**](link-usernames-and-email.md)
* [**Receive tokens or NFTs via username or email** ](receive-on-internal-address.md)
* [**Transfer of tokens or NFTs from Internal Address to Personal Address** ](transfer-from-internal-to-personal-address.md)
* [**Sending tokens or NFTs from an Internal Address to a blockchain-address, either by username or email** ](send-from-internal-address.md)
* [**Sending tokens or NFTs from an Internal Address by a list that consists of blockchain-addresses, usernames and/or emails** ](multi-send-from-internal-address.md)
* [**Exchange of tokens from the Internal Address to any other tokens in the Liquidity Pools**](exchange-from-internal-address.md)
