# Sputnik Network App-chain

**Sputnik Network App-chain** is a blockchain based on the [**Cosmos SDK**](https://docs.cosmos.network/), specially launched to implement the decentralized functionality of the [**Sputnik App**](../sputnik-app/)&#x20;

In other words, **Sputnik Network App-chain** plays the role of a decentralized server for [**Sputnik App**](../sputnik-app/)&#x20;

**Sputnik Network App-chain** has the following functionality:&#x20;

* Sending and receiving tokens, both within the network and through IBC&#x20;
* Delegation (staking) of tokens&#x20;
* Creating proposals and voting on proposals&#x20;
* Creation of liquidity pools and provision of liquidity&#x20;
* Creating multi-signature addresses&#x20;
* Creation and transfer of NFT&#x20;
* Creation of InterChain Accounts&#x20;
* Granting permissions from one address to another (auto-restake is one of the results of this function)&#x20;

In the **Sputnik Network**,the $SIGNAL token is used for the security, decentralized governance and transaction fees&#x20;

Since the above functionality represents transactions on the blockchain and requires a fee for sending the transaction, users will be given several "free transactions" per day (transactions will be free for users, but not for the blockchain - the fee for these "free transactions" will be paid from the business address ( feegrant module))&#x20;

The amount of “free transactions” will be restored every day, but will not accumulate, so no more than 5 free transactions can be sent daily from each [**Personal Account**](../sputnik-app/personal-account.md)&#x20;

This functionality will significantly simplify login for users who are just starting to join the Web3, and will also help resolve a long-standing discrepancy: “To receive cryptocurrency to an address, you need to pay a transaction fee, and to pay a transaction fee, you need to have cryptocurrency on the address.”&#x20;

It will be possible to launch any number of decentralized applications on the **Sputnik Network**, and the following dApps will initially be launched:&#x20;

* [**Sputnik dApp**](sputnik-dapp.md)&#x20;
* [**Sputnik DEX**](sputnik-dex.md)&#x20;

These dApps can be used independently, but will also complement and interact with each other and with the [**Sputnik App**](../sputnik-app/)
