# Sputnik DEX

**Sputnik DEX** will provide the following functionality for [**Sputnik App**](../sputnik-app/):&#x20;

* Quick exchange of one token for another&#x20;
* Creation of Liquidity Pools&#x20;
* Providing the liquidity&#x20;
* Receiving rewards for providing liquidity&#x20;

The main difference between **Sputnik DEX** and all other decentralized exchanges will be the modernized liquidity pool module, which will allow you to exchange small quantities of one token for another with minimal slippage even in pools with low liquidity&#x20;

The exact model of liquidity pools on **Sputnik DEX** will be more similar to the [**Curve**](https://resources.curve.fi/base-features/understanding-curve/#whitepaper) model and will be published soon&#x20;

On **Sputnik DEX**:&#x20;

* Rewards for providing liquidity will only be for pools paired with $**SIGNAL**&#x20;
* All token exchanges from other networks will occur through the $**SIGNAL** token&#x20;
* **Sputnik DEX** will be governed by $**SIGNAL** stakers&#x20;
* All transactions and creation of liquidity pools will be paid in $**SIGNAL**&#x20;

All of it will add functionality for the $**SIGNAL** token, as well as increase the amount of transactions in the [**Sputnik Network App-chain**](./)
