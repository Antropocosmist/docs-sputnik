# Sputnik NFT

**!!! This is the not final version !!!**

**!!! All parameters and criteria can be changed at any time, and moreover, will definitely be changed during the testnet !!!**

**!!! The final version of the distribution will be approved after the testnet and before the mainnet launch !!!**

Before the mainnet launch, Sputnik NFTs will be released, which will consist of three collections:

* Satellites - on OmniFlix - 33,000 NFTs
* Dishes - on Injective - 33,000 NFTs
* Scientists - on Stargaze - 33,000 NFTs

Sputnik NFTs from each collection will be distributed to active NFT users on OmniFlix, Injective and Stargaze, as well as to [NFT-holders](../nft-holders/) collections that fall under the $**SIGNAL** [StakeDrop](../)&#x20;

* NFTs from the Satellites collection will "emit" $**SIGNAL** - maximum possible emit 19,352,200 $**SIGNAL**
* NFTs from the Dishes collection will "receive" $**SIGNAL** - maximum possible receive 19,320,350 $**SIGNAL**
* NFTs from the Scientists collection will "process" $**SIGNAL** - maximum possible process 19,344,500 $**SIGNAL**

Maximun of 19,320,350 $**SIGNAL** distribution via **Sputnik NFTs** will be distributed to users who collect a full set: **Satellites** + **Dishes** + **Scientists**&#x20;

**Satellites NFTs**, **Dishes NFTs** and **Scientists NFTs** will have different rarity

NFT rarity is made up of Type + Background, and affects the amount of $**SIGNAL** emitted, received and processed

* **Satellites NFTs** will have 5 different Types, each of them will have 5 different Sub-Types (total: 25 different kinds) + 10 different Types of Background&#x20;
* **Dishes NFTs** will have 5 different Types, each of them will have 5 different Sub-Types (total: 25 different kinds) + 10 different Types of Background&#x20;
* **Scientists NFTs** will have 3 different Types, each of them will have 5 different Sub-Types (total: 15 different kinds) + 10 different Types of Background&#x20;

Each NFT will be randomly composed of a Type and a Background, and as a result, will emit, receive or process a unique amount of $**SIGNAL**

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (9).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Example: Dish with Type 2.4 and Background 1.7 will be Dish-2.4.7 and will receive 850+350=1200 $SIGNAL</p></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (10).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Example: Scientist with Type 1.5 and Background 1.4 will be Scientist-1.5.4 and will process 600+200=800 $SIGNAL</p></figcaption></figure>

**Example**:&#x20;

_If a user collected Satelite-3.2.6 + Dishe-2.4.7 + Scientist-1.5.4, then the amount of $**SIGNAL** that user will receive during the distribution is 800 $**SIGNAL**:_\
_- Satelite-3.2.6 emits 1650 $**SIGNAL**_\
_**-** Dishe-2.4.7 can receive only 1200 $**SIGNAL** from 1650 emited_\
_- Scientist-1.5.4 can process only 800 $**SIGNAL** from 1200 received_

_In order to receive 1650 $**SIGNAL**, the user will need to collect additional NFTs, for example:_ \
_- Dish-1.2.2 to receive additional 450 $SIGNAL_\
_- Scientist-2.2.1 to process additional 850 $SIGNAL_&#x20;

All non-distributed $**SIGNAL** with **Sputnik NFTs** will go to [Sputnik Foundation](../../../../sputnik-foundation.md) and/or [Community Pool](../../creating-pools/community-pool.md)

The responsibility for the release of the **Sputnik NFT** collection is on the [Sputnik Foundation](../../../../sputnik-foundation.md)
