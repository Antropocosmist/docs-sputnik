# Stakers of projects that will provide their coins to create Liquidity Pools in pairs with $SIGNAL

**!!! This is the not final version !!!**

**!!! All parameters and criteria can be changed at any time, and moreover, will definitely be changed during the testnet !!!**

**!!! The final version of the distribution will be approved after the testnet and before the mainnet launch !!!**

* Delegators from different networks of the [**Cosmos Ecosystem**](../../../../glossary-of-terms-and-scheme/cosmos-ecosystem.md) will be eligible for $**SIGNAL** [**StakeDrop**](../) with proportional distribution&#x20;
* This means that a delegator with 10 addresses, each delegating (staking) 10 coins, will be eligible for the same amount of $**SIGNAL** as a delegator with one address that has delegated 100 coins&#x20;
* [**StakeDrop**](../) will be based on unexpected network snapshots. \
  The date and time of the snapshots will be announced after they will be taken. \
  Snapshots will happen after the finishing of the [**Sputnik Network**](../../../../sputnik-network-app-chain/) test-net

Delegators of the following validators will be excluded from the [**StakeDrop**](../):&#x20;

* CEX-validators (Centralized exchanges ala Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, etc.)&#x20;
* Validators from venture capital funds&#x20;
* Validators with a participation rate of less than 34% of the proposals they had the opportunity to vote on (this means that if a validator recently joined the network and only had the opportunity to vote on 10 proposals at the time of the snapshot, their delegators will be excluded from the [**StakeDrop**](../) if the validator voted on 3 or fewer proposals out of 10 possible; If such a validator voted on 4 or more proposals out of 10 possible, then the validatorâ€™s participation level is more than 34%, which means their delegators will be eligible for a [**StakeDrop**](../))&#x20;
* Validators with 0% commission&#x20;

In addition, the following addresses will be excluded from the list for [**StakeDrop**](../):&#x20;

* Addresses from which projects delegate large amounts to validators. \
  We are confident that all projects will understand this, since our goal is to widely distribute $**SIGNAL** among users of the [**Cosmos Ecosystem**](../../../../glossary-of-terms-and-scheme/cosmos-ecosystem.md), and this [**StakeDrop**](../) is already supporting projects in the [**Cosmos Ecosystem**](../../../../glossary-of-terms-and-scheme/cosmos-ecosystem.md) by distributing [**StakeDrop**](../) to their users (stakers), which already adds additional value to these projects&#x20;
* Addresses to which funds came from the addresses of large holders. \
  In other words, if an address with a large number of coins has distributed its coins in smaller quantities across several addresses, all these addresses will be excluded from the list for [**StakeDrop**](../) (a large number of coins will be determined for each network individually, based on network snapshots, after the end of the [**Sputnik Network**](../../../../sputnik-network-app-chain/) test-net). \
  Firstly, this will prevent the concentration of a large amount of $**SIGNAL** in the hands of a small amount of players; \
  Secondly, the target audience of the [**Sputnik App**](../../../../sputnik-app/) is not large stake holders, but individual users of the [**Cosmos Ecosystem**](../../../../glossary-of-terms-and-scheme/cosmos-ecosystem.md);&#x20;
* All stakers of AARON will be excluded from StakeDrop of $**SIGNAL**
* All addresses that received an airdrop from AARON will have multiplier x0.1 on StakeDrop of $**SIGNAL**&#x20;

**120,000,000** $**SIGNAL** will be allocated for the [**StakeDrop**](../)&#x20;

The exact list of networks for the $SIGNAL [**StakeDrop**](../) will be published after the finishing of the [**Sputnik Network**](../../../../sputnik-network-app-chain/) test-net

However, it can already be stated that delegators (stakers) of the following networks will be eligible for [**StakeDrop**](../):&#x20;

* [Akash Network](https://akash.network/) $AKT - 5,000,000 $**SIGNAL**
* [Cosmos Hub](https://cosmos.network/) $ATOM - 30,000,000 $**SIGNAL**
* [Cyber](https://cyb.ai/) (Bostrom) $BOOT - 5,000,000 $**SIGNAL**
* [Dungeon Chain](https://cryptodungeon.org/) $DGN - 5,000,000 $**SIGNAL**
* [Drop.money](https://www.drop.money/) $DROP - 5,000,000 $**SIGNAL**
* [Dymension](https://dymension.xyz/) $DYM - 10,000,000 $**SIGNAL**
* [Humans.ai](https://humans.ai/) $HEART - 5,000,000 $**SIGNAL**
* [Injective](https://injective.com/) $INJ - 10,000,000 $**SIGNAL**
* [Juno Network](https://junonetwork.io/) $JUNO - 10,000,000 $**SIGNAL**
* [OmniFlix Network](https://www.omniflix.network/) $FLIX - 10,000,000 $**SIGNAL**
* [Osmosis](https://osmosis.zone/) $OSMO - 10,000,000 $**SIGNAL**
* [Persistence](https://persistence.one/) $XPRT - 5,000,000 $**SIGNAL**
* [Secret Network](https://scrt.network/) $SCRT - 5,000,000 $**SIGNAL**
* [Source Protocol](https://www.sourceprotocol.io/) $SOURCE - 5,000,000 $**SIGNAL**

!!! This is not the entire list! The full list of networks eligible for the $**SIGNAL** [**StakeDrop**](../) will be published after the end of the test-net and before the launch of the [**Sputnik Network**](../../../../sputnik-network-app-chain/) mainnet !!!
