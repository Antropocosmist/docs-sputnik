# StakingRewards Pool

**120,000,000 $SIGNAL** **(\~ 11.72% of the Total Supply)** will be allocated to the **StakingRewards Pool**

**StakingRewards Pool** - pool to pay rewards to validators and delegators for providing security (for $**SIGNAL** staking)

**StakingRewards Pool** is directly connected to [**Liquidity Rewards Pool**](liquidityrewards-pool.md)

Once per day, a reward will be distributed from the **StakingRewards Pool** to [**Validators**](../vesting/validators/) and **Delegators**&#x20;

The amount of reward to be distributed will be equivalent to 10% APR

In case the number of $**SIGNAL** in staking significantly exceeds the number of $**SIGNAL** in liquidity pools, the missing $**SIGNAL** for the staking reward will be taken from the [**LiquidityRewards Pool**](liquidityrewards-pool.md)

**Math:**

Even if 700M of $**SIGNAL** will be in staking (that is mean no $SIGNAL in liquidity pools), the rewards in equivalent to 10% APR from the **StakingRewards Pool** need to be:

* 1st year - 70M $**SIGNAL**
* 2nd year - 77M $**SIGNAL**&#x20;
* 3rd year - 84.7M $**SIGNAL**

Total: 231.7M $**SIGNAL**

And the total amount of $**SIGNAL** in **StakingRewards Pool** and in [**LiquidityRewards Pool**](liquidityrewards-pool.md) is 240M $**SIGNAL**&#x20;

Alternative Model:

* 1st year - 30M $**SIGNAL** will be distributed by $**SIGNAL-stakers**
* 2nd year - 40M $**SIGNAL** will be distributed by $**SIGNAL-stakers**
* 3rd year - 50M $**SIGNAL** will be distributed by $**SIGNAL-stakers**

Total: 120M **$SIGNAL**

The final Staking Reward Distribution Model will be chosen during the testnet

After 3 years, [**Sputnik Network**](../../../sputnik-network-app-chain/) will be moved to security of [**Decentralized Digital PostState**](../../usdsignal-tokenomics/transition-to-poststate-blockchain-security.md), all non-used $**SIGNAL** from **StakingRewards Pool** will be burned, and tokenomis will be changed
