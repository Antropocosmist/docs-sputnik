# Liquidity Pools

**150,000,000 $SIGNAL** **(\~ 14.65% of the Total Supply)** will be used to create **Liquidity Pools** with $**SIGNAL**, both on [**Sputnik DEX**](../../../sputnik-network-app-chain/sputnik-dex.md), and on other friendly DEXes such as:

* [**Osmosis**](https://app.osmosis.zone/)
* [**Astroport**](https://app.astroport.fi/)
* [**Dexter**](https://app.dexter.zone/)
* [**Source Swap**](https://www.sourceprotocol.io/)&#x20;
* [**Elys Network**](https://elys.network/)
* [**BeeZee DEX**](https://app.getbze.com/)

**! This is not a complete list of decentralized exchanges. Stay tuned**

**Liquidity Pools** in pairs with $**SIGNAL** will be created with the coins of those projects whose stakers will receive the [**StreamDrop**](../streamdrop/), as well as with the coins of those exchanges where the **Liquidity Pools** will be created&#x20;

The placement of **Liquidity Pools** on **DEX** will depend on the number of coins that **DEX** provides to create a **Liquidity Pool** in pairs with $**SIGNAL**&#x20;

All rewards for providing liquidity and exchange fees will go to community pools or DAO treasuries that are responsible for the provided liquidity&#x20;

**Example #1:**&#x20;

_If **Astroport** provides $**ASTRO** equivalent to $**100,000** - **Sputnik Network** will provide **1,000,000** $**SIGNAL**, and an **ASTRO/SIGNAL** pool will be created on **Astroport**, and in addition, several more pools will be placed on **Astroport** in pairs with $**SIGNAL** with liquidity of at least $**100,000**_&#x20;

_50% of the rewards for providing liquidity, as well as 50% of the swap-fees will go to the **Astroport** treasury, and the other 50% will go to the_ [_**Sputnik Foundation**_](../../../sputnik-foundation.md) _treasury_&#x20;

**Example #2:**&#x20;

_If **Elys Network** provides $**ASTRO** equivalent to $**100,000** - **Sputnik Network** will provide **1,000,000** $**SIGNAL**, and an **ASTRO/SIGNAL** pool will be created on **Elys Network**, and in addition, several more pools will be placed on **Elys Network** in pairs with $**SIGNAL** with liquidity of at least $**100,000**_&#x20;

_50% of the rewards for providing liquidity, as well as 50% of the swap-fees will go to the **Elys Network** community pool, and the other 50% will go to the_ [_**Sputnik Foundation**_](../../../sputnik-foundation.md) _treasury_&#x20;
