# Validators

**50,000,000 $SIGNAL** **(\~ 4.88% of the Initial Supply)** will be distributed among **validators** at the launch of the [**Sputnik Network**](../../../../sputnik-network-app-chain/) main-net, **with vesting for 1 year**.&#x20;

* These tokens will be specified in the genesis file and will be on the addresses of genesis validators, in the form of a self-bonded tokens
* Validators will be able to unbond and withdraw these tokens from the self-bond only after 1 year
* These tokens will be distributed among validators based on their contribution to the development of the [**Sputnik Network App-chain**](../../../../sputnik-network-app-chain/)&#x20;

The rules apply to this distribution:&#x20;

* No more than 500,000 **$SIGNAL** per Validator&#x20;
* The exact amount will depend on the validator's contribution for the development of the Sputnik Network&#x20;
* Any undistributed **$SIGNAL** will go to [Sputnik Foundation](../../../../sputnik-foundation.md), or will go to the [Community Pool](../../creating-pools/community-pool.md) - details on this will be clarified closer to the launch of the mainnet
