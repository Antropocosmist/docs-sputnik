# Early users

[**Sputnik App**](../../../sputnik-app/) is available now:&#x20;

* To send by Twitter username: [https://sputnik.exchange/](https://sputnik.exchange/)&#x20;
* To send by Telegram usernames: [https://t.me/SputnikNetworkBot](https://t.me/SputnikNetworkBot)&#x20;

At the test-net stage we will actively test [**Sputnik App**](../../../sputnik-app/)

Early Users campaign will take place on [**Centrifuge Platform**](https://centrifuge.digital/)

All users who will use the [**Sputnik App**](../../../sputnik-app/) before the launch of the main-net will be eligible for the $**SIGNAL** [**StreamDrop**](../streamdrop/)&#x20;

The rules apply to this distribution:&#x20;

* No more than **10,000** **$SIGNAL** per **Early User**
* The exact amount will depend on the Early User's contribution to the development of the [Sputnik Network](../../../sputnik-network-app-chain/)&#x20;
* Any undistributed **$SIGNAL** will go to [Sputnik Foundation](../../../sputnik-foundation.md), or will go to the [Community Pool](../creating-pools/community-pool.md) - details on this will be clarified closer to the launch of the main network

More detailed information will be published soon
