# $SIGNAL Tokenomics

**! This tokenomics is the initial tokenomics for the** [**Sputnik Network**](../../sputnik-network-app-chain/) **test-net, and can be changed during or after the end of the** [**Sputnik Network**](../../sputnik-network-app-chain/) **test-net**

**!! The tokenomics of the** [**Sputnik Network**](../../sputnik-network-app-chain/) **main-net may or may not differ from this tokenomics**

**!!! The final version of the $SIGNAL tokenomics will be approved after the end of the test-net, and before the launch of the** [**Sputnik Network**](../../sputnik-network-app-chain/) **main-net**

The $**SIGNAL** token has a deflationary and capped model with predictable burning, which means:&#x20;

* The **Total Supply** of $**SIGNAL** is **1,024,000,000** will be issued with the launch of mainnet
* For the first 3 years, rewards for staking and liquidity providing will be not from inflation, but from  [**StakingRewards Pool**](../usdsignal-token-distribution/creating-pools/stakingrewards-pool.md) and [**Liquidity Rewards Pool**](../usdsignal-token-distribution/creating-pools/liquidityrewards-pool.md)
* Rewards from pools will be in equivalent to 10% APR, or it will be constant amount (decision will be made in the process of testnet)
* After 3 years, [**Sputnik Network**](../../sputnik-network-app-chain/) will [switch to PostState Blockchain security](transition-to-poststate-blockchain-security.md), similar to [**InterChain Security**](https://cosmos.network/interchain-security/)&#x20;
* All non-used $SIGNAL from [**StakingRewards Pool**](../usdsignal-token-distribution/creating-pools/stakingrewards-pool.md), [**Liquidity Rewards Pool**](../usdsignal-token-distribution/creating-pools/liquidityrewards-pool.md) and [**Community Pool**](../usdsignal-token-distribution/creating-pools/community-pool.md) - will  be burned
* In the unlikely event that [**PostState Blockchain**](https://github.com/PostState) is not launched by this time, rewards for providing network security (staking) for [**Sputnik Network**](../../sputnik-network-app-chain/) will be paid from the [**Community Pool**](../usdsignal-token-distribution/creating-pools/community-pool.md) and/or from [**Sputnik Foundation**](../../sputnik-foundation.md) treasury until [**PostState Blockchain**](https://github.com/PostState) is launched
