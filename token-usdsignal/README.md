# Token $SIGNAL

_"When Sputnik first crossed the sky, I looked up and thought about the predetermination of the future. After all, that little light, moving rapidly from one end of the sky to the other, was the future of all mankind."_

<mark style="color:red;">**!!! This is the not final version !!!**</mark>

<mark style="color:red;">**!!! All parameters and criteria can be changed at any time, and moreover, will definitely be changed during the testnet !!!**</mark>

<mark style="color:red;">**!!! The final version of the distribution will be approved after the testnet and before the mainnet launch !!!**</mark>

* 1 $SIGNAL = 1,000,000 uSIGNAL

* Initial Token Release: 1,024,000,000 $SIGNAL

The main usability of the $**SIGNAL** token:&#x20;

## Payment for transactions in the [Sputnik Network](../sputnik-network-app-chain/)&#x20;

* All transactions within the [Sputnik Network App-chain](../sputnik-network-app-chain/) require payment in $**SIGNAL**&#x20;
* All transactions within the [Sputnik Network App-chain](../sputnik-network-app-chain/) can be divided into two types: **Simple** and **Complex**

## Simple transactions:&#x20;

<mark style="color:red;">!!! This list will be expanded !!!</mark>&#x20;

* attaching an address to a username, or attaching a username to a username, or attaching an address to an address&#x20;
* attaching an address to an NFT&#x20;
* sending from a username to an address or to another username&#x20;
* exchanging one coin for another&#x20;
* exchanging one NFT for another&#x20;
* delegating coins&#x20;
* re-delegating coins&#x20;
* unbonding coins from a delegation&#x20;
* replenishing liquidity pools&#x20;
* voting on proposals&#x20;

## Complex transactions:&#x20;

<mark style="color:red;">!!! This list will be expanded !!!</mark>&#x20;

* sending coins to a list of addresses or usernames&#x20;
* sending NFTs to a list of addresses or usernames&#x20;
* creating and burning personal tokens&#x20;
* creating and burning NFTs and SBTs&#x20;
* creating NFT gifts with a pre-set value&#x20;
* creating Liquidity Pools on Sputnik DEX&#x20;
* creating a Trading Pair on Sputnik DEX (the ability to trade your own tokens through the Order Book, without providing liquidity)

**Note:**

* A user who has connected to the [Sputnik App](../sputnik-app/) via the [Web2 service](../glossary-of-terms-and-scheme/web2.md) and has not attached a Personal Address can send a limited number of "free transactions" daily - payment for such transactions will be made in $**SIGNAL** from the [PayFees Pool](usdsignal-token-distribution/creating-pools/payfees-pool.md), but Complex transactions will require payment in $SIGNAL&#x20;
* A user who has connected to the [Sputnik App](../sputnik-app/) and attached a Personal Address can send an unlimited number of transactions, but must pay for transactions in $**SIGNAL** independently
* Payment for transactions in $SIGNAL will be regulated by Validators, depending on the market price of $SIGNAL:\
  \- the higher the price of $SIGNAL on the market, the less $SIGNAL is needed to complete a transaction\
  \- the lower the price of $SIGNAL on the market, the more $SIGNAL is needed to complete a transaction

_Example:_&#x20;

_If 1 $**SIGNAL** costs 0.10$, then to send tokens and/or NFTs to 100 addresses and/or usernames, the user must pay: 0.01$ for 10 addresses -> 0.001$ per address -> 1$ for sending to 1000 addresses_&#x20;

_If the price of $**SIGNAL** goes up, and 1 $**SIGNAL** costs 1$, and users stop sending transactions to lists of addresses because the price is too high ($10 for sending to 1000 addresses), then validators will reduce the payment in $**SIGNAL**, and 1 $SIGNAL will be enough to pay for a transaction to 1000 addresses ($1 for sending to 1000 addresses)_&#x20;

_If the price of $**SIGNAL** goes down, and 1 $**SIGNAL** costs 0.01$, and it is not profitable for validators to provide security network because the price is too low ($0.1 for sending to 1000 addresses), then the validators will increase the payment in $**SIGNAL**, and 1 $**SIGNAL** will be enough to pay for a transaction to 10 addresses ($1 for sending to 1000 addresses)_&#x20;

_! Please note that this is just an example that describes the self-regulation mechanism between the market price of $**SIGNAL** and the utility of $**SIGNAL**_&#x20;

_!! The actual numbers will be the result of a mutually beneficial consensus between the needs of users to send transactions and the interests of validators_&#x20;

## Providing security for the [Sputnik Network](../sputnik-network-app-chain/)&#x20;

* Validators and delegators will be able to hold $**SIGNAL** to provide security for the network&#x20;
* Validators and delegators will receive a reward for holding $**SIGNAL** for the first three years, until the [Sputnik App-Chain](https://app.gitbook.com/o/fn2QUCcI4Laks25XW58Z/s/DLfrEiPChR9U2aAlWxri/) transfers security for the [PostState](usdsignal-tokenomics/transition-to-poststate-blockchain-security.md) network&#x20;

## Providing Liquidity in pairs with $SIGNAL&#x20;

* Projects and users will be able to provide liquidity in $**SIGNAL** pairs, both on [**Sputnik DEX**](../sputnik-network-app-chain/sputnik-dex.md) and on other friendly DEXs&#x20;
* Projects and users will receive a reward for providing liquidity in pairs with $SIGNAL for the first three years from the [**LiquidityRewards Pool**](usdsignal-token-distribution/creating-pools/liquidityrewards-pool.md), until the [**Sputnik App-Chain**](https://app.gitbook.com/o/fn2QUCcI4Laks25XW58Z/s/DLfrEiPChR9U2aAlWxri/) is transferred to the [**PostState**](usdsignal-tokenomics/transition-to-poststate-blockchain-security.md) network for security&#x20;
* Distribution of rewards for providing liquidity in $**SIGNAL** pairs, both on [**Sputnik DEX**](../sputnik-network-app-chain/sputnik-dex.md) and on other DEXs, will be determined by the [**Sputnik Foundation**](../sputnik-foundation.md)

## Decentralized governance of the [Sputnik Network](../sputnik-network-app-chain/)&#x20;

* For staking $**SIGNAL**, validators and delegators will not only receive a reward for the first three years, but also **Voting Power** to participate in the **Decentralized Governance of the Network**&#x20;
* All issues related to changing parameters will be resolved by creating and voting on proposals&#x20;
